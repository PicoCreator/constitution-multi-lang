The Constitution, as laid down on 17 May 1814 by the Constituent Assembly at Eidsvoll,

subsequently amended,

most recently by Resolution of 12 January 2023.

A. Form of Government

Article 1.
The Kingdom of Norway is a free, independent, indivisible and inalienable realm. Its form of government is a limited and hereditary monarchy.


Article 2.
Our values will remain our Christian and humanist heritage. This Constitution shall ensure democracy, a state based on the rule of law and human rights.


B. The executive power, the King And the Royal Family and Religion

Article 3.
The executive power is vested in the King, or in the Queen if she has succeeded to the Crown pursuant to the provisions of Article 6 or Article 7 or Article 48 of this Constitution. When the executive power is thus vested in the Queen, she has all the rights and obligations which pursuant to this Constitution and the law of the land are possessed by the King.


Article 4.
The King shall at all times profess the Evangelical-Lutheran religion.


Article 5.
The King's person cannot be censured or accused. The responsibility rests with his Council.


Article 6.
The order of succession is lineal, so that only a child born in lawful wedlock of the Queen or King, or of one who is herself or himself entitled to the succession, may succeed, and so that the nearest line shall take precedence over the more remote and the elder in the line over the younger.

An unborn child shall also be included among those entitled to the succession and shall immediately take her or his proper place in the line of succession as soon as she or he is born into the world.

The right of succession shall not, however, belong to any person who is not born in the direct line of descent from the last reigning Queen or King or a sister or brother thereof, or is not herself or himself a sister or brother thereof.

When a Princess or Prince entitled to succeed to the Crown of Norway is born, her or his name and time of birth shall be notified to the first Storting in session and be entered in the record of its proceedings.

For those born before the year 1971, Article 6 of the Constitution as it was passed on 18 November 1905 shall, however, apply. For those born before the year 1990 it shall nevertheless be the case that a male shall take precedence over a female.


Article 7.
If there is no Princess or Prince entitled to the succession, the King may propose his successor to the Storting, which has the right to make the choice if the King's proposal is not accepted.


Article 8.
The age of majority of the King shall be laid down by law.

As soon as the King has attained the age prescribed by law, he shall make a public declaration that he is of age.


Article 9.
As soon as the King, being of age, accedes to the Government, he shall take the following oath before the Storting: «I promise and swear that I will govern the Kingdom of Norway in accordance with its Constitution and Laws; so help me God, the Almighty and Omniscient.»

If the Storting is not in session at the time, the oath shall be made in writing in the Council of State and be repeated solemnly by the King at the first subsequent Storting.


Article 10.
(Repealed by Resolution of 14 March 1908.)

Article 11.
The King shall reside in the realm and may not, without the consent of the Storting, remain outside the realm for more than six months at a time, otherwise he shall have forfeited, for his person, the right to the Crown.

The King may not accept any other crown or government without the consent of the Storting, for which two thirds of the votes are required.


Article 12.
The King himself chooses a Council from among Norwegian citizens who are entitled to vote. This Council shall consist of a Prime Minister and at least seven other Members.

The King apportions the business among the Members of the Council of State as he deems appropriate. Under extraordinary circumstances, besides the ordinary Members of the Council of State, the King may summon other Norwegian citizens, although no Members of the Storting, to take a seat in the Council of State.

Husband and wife, parent and child or two siblings may never sit at the same time in the Council of State.


Article 13.
During his travels within the realm, the King may delegate the administration of the realm to the Council of State. The Council of State shall conduct the Government in the King's name and on his behalf. It shall scrupulously observe the provisions of this Constitution, as well as such particular directives in conformity therewith as the King may instruct.

The matters of business shall be decided by voting, where in the event of the votes being equal, the Prime Minister, or in his absence the highest-ranking Member of the Council of State who is present, shall have two votes.

The Council of State shall make a report to the King on matters of business which it thus decides.


Article 14.
The King may appoint state secretaries to assist Members of the Council of State with their duties outside the Council of State. Each state secretary shall act on behalf of the Member of the Council of State to whom he or she is attached to the extent determined by that Member.


Article 15.
Any person who holds a seat in the Council of State has the duty to submit his application to resign once the Storting has passed a vote of no confidence against that Member of the Council of State or against the Council of State as a whole.

The King is bound to grant such an application to resign.

Once the Storting has passed a vote of no confidence, only such business may be conducted as is required for the proper discharge of duties.


Article 16.
All inhabitants of the realm shall have the right to free exercise of their religion. The Church of Norway, an Evangelical-Lutheran church, will remain the Established Church of Norway and will as such be supported by the State. Detailed provisions as to its system will be laid down by law. All religious and belief communities should be supported on equal terms.


Article 17.
The King may issue and repeal ordinances relating to commerce, customs, all livelihoods and the public administration, although these must not conflict with the Constitution or with the laws passed by the Storting as hereinafter prescribed in Articles 76, 77, 78 and 79. They shall apply on a provisional basis until the next Storting.


Article 18.
As a general rule the King shall provide for the collection of the taxes and duties imposed by the Storting.


Article 19.
The King shall ensure that the properties and regalia of the state are utilised and administered in the manner determined by the Storting and in the best interests of the general public.


Article 20.
The King shall have the right in the Council of State to pardon criminals after sentence has been passed. The criminal shall have the choice of accepting the King's pardon or submitting to the penalty imposed.

In proceedings which the Storting causes to be brought before the Court of Impeachment, no pardon other than deliverance from the death penalty may be granted, unless the Storting has given its consent thereto.


Article 21.
The King shall choose and appoint, after consultation with his Council of State, all senior civil and military officials. These officials shall have a duty of obedience and allegiance to the Constitution and the King. The Royal Princes and Princesses must not hold senior civil offices.


Article 22.
The Prime Minister and the other Members of the Council of State, together with the state secretaries, may be dismissed by the King without any prior court judgment, after he has heard the opinion of the Council of State on the subject. The same applies to senior officials employed in government ministries or in the diplomatic or consular service, the highest-ranking civil officials, commanders of regiments and other military formations, commandants of fortresses and officers commanding warships. Whether pensions should be granted to senior officials thus dismissed shall be determined by the next Storting. In the interval they shall receive two thirds of their previous pay.

Other senior officials may only be suspended by the King, and must then without delay be charged before the Courts, but they may not, except by court judgment, be dismissed nor, against their will, transferred.

All senior officials may, without a prior court judgment, be discharged from office upon attaining the statutory age limit. It may be determined by law that certain senior officials who are not judges may be appointed for a term of years.


Article 23.
The King may bestow orders upon whomever he pleases as a reward for distinguished services, and such orders must be publicly announced, but no rank or title other than that attached to any office. The order exempts no one from the common duties and burdens of citizens, nor does it carry with it any preferential admission to senior official posts in the state. Senior officials honourably discharged from office retain the title and rank of their office. This does not apply, however, to Members of the Council of State or the state secretaries.

No personal, or mixed, hereditary privileges may henceforth be granted to anyone.


Article 24.
The King chooses and dismisses, at his own discretion, his royal household and court officials.


Article 25.
The King is commander-in-chief of the armed forces of the realm. These forces may not be increased or reduced without the consent of the Storting. They may not be transferred to the service of foreign powers, nor may the military forces of any foreign power, except auxiliary forces assisting against hostile attack, be brought into the realm without the consent of the Storting.

The territorial army and the other troops which cannot be classed as troops of the line must never, without the consent of the Storting, be employed outside the borders of the realm.

The Government does not have the right to use military force against the inhabitants except according to law unless an assembly disturbs the public peace and does not immediately dissolve after the statutory provisions that relate to revolt, three times loudly and clearly, are read to the assembly by the civil authorities.


Article 26.
The King has the right to call up troops, to engage in war in defence of the realm and to make peace, to conclude and denounce treaties, to send and to receive diplomatic envoys.

Treaties on matters of special importance, and, in all cases, treaties whose implementation, according to the Constitution, necessitates a new law or a decision by the Storting, are not binding until the Storting has given its consent thereto.


Article 27.
All Members of the Council of State shall, unless lawfully absent, attend the Council of State. No decision may be adopted there unless more than half the number of Members are present.


Article 28.
Recommendations regarding appointments to senior official posts and other matters of importance shall be presented in the Council of State by the Member within whose competence they fall, and such matters shall be dealt with by them in accordance with the decision adopted in the Council of State. However, matters strictly relating to military command may, to the extent determined by the King, be excepted from proceedings in the Council of State.


Article 29.
If a Member of the Council of State is prevented due to lawful absence from attending the meeting and from presenting the matters that fall within his competence, these shall be presented by another Member temporarily appointed by the King for the purpose.

If so many Members are prevented due to lawful absence from attending that not more than half of the stipulated number are present, the requisite number of other men or women shall be temporarily appointed to take a seat in the Council of State.


Article 30.
All the proceedings of the Council of State shall be entered in its records. Diplomatic matters which the Council of State decides to keep secret shall be entered in a special record. The same applies to military command matters which the Council of State decides to keep secret.

Everyone who has a seat in the Council of State has the duty frankly to express their opinion, to which the King is bound to listen. But it rests with the King to make a decision according to his own judgment.

If any Member of the Council of State is of the opinion that the King's decision conflicts with the form of government or the laws of the realm, it is his duty to make strong remonstrances against it, as well as to enter his opinion in the records. A Member who has not thus protested is deemed to have been in agreement with the King, and shall be answerable in such manner as may be subsequently decided, and may be impeached by the Storting before the Court of Impeachment.


Article 31.
All decisions drawn up by the King shall, in order to become valid, be countersigned. Decisions relating to military command are countersigned by the person who has presented the matter, while other decisions are countersigned by the Prime Minister or, if he has not been present, by the highest-ranking Member of the Council of State present.


Article 32.
The decisions adopted by the Government during the King's absence shall be drawn up in the King's name and be signed by the Council of State.

Article 36.
A Prince or Princess entitled to succeed to the Crown of Norway may not marry without the consent of the King. Nor may he or she accept any other crown or government without the consent of the King and the Storting. For the consent of the Storting two thirds of the votes are required.

If he or she acts contrary to this rule, they and their descendants forfeit their right to the throne of Norway.

The extension or postponement may be adopted only as far as is necessary to ensure that the electorate has the possibility to vote. The election proceedings must be concluded within one month after the day the King in Council has set as the election day.

The number of Members of the Storting to be elected from each constituency is determined on the basis of a calculation of the ratio between the number of inhabitants and surface area of each constituency, and the number of inhabitants and surface area of the entire realm. In this calculation, each inhabitant counts as one point and each square kilometre counts as 1.8 points.

The directly elected Members of the Storting are elected from each constituency by proportional representation according to the Sainte-Laguë method, with 1.4 as the first distribution figure. The party which in accordance with the foregoing obtains the largest quotient is allotted the first seat, while the second seat is allotted to the party with the second largest quotient, and so on until all the seats are distributed.

The seats at large are distributed among the registered political parties which have put up lists in all the constituencies and which have received at least four per cent of the approved votes in the entire realm.

The seats at large are distributed on the basis of the parties’ total number of votes in the entire realm. Votes and seats for lists that do not meet the requirement in the third paragraph are kept out of the count. A calculation is carried out using the Sainte-Laguë method, with 1.4 as the first distribution figure. The seats at large are allotted to the parties which have received fewer directly elected seats than that which follows from this calculation.

Specific provisions concerning in which constituencies the parties shall receive seats at large shall be laid down by law.

List alliances are prohibited.

No deliberations may take place in the presence of the King.

When the proceedings of the Storting have been opened, the Prime Minister and the Members of the Council of State have the right to attend the Storting and, like its Members, although without voting, to take part in any proceedings conducted in open session, while in matters discussed in closed session only insofar as permitted by the Storting.

Every Bill shall first be proposed in the Storting, either by one of its own Members, or by the Government through a Member of the Council of State.

Once the Bill is passed there, a new deliberation is to take place in the Storting, which either approves or rejects it. In the latter case the Bill, with the comments appended by the Storting, shall again be taken into consideration by the Storting, which either shelves the Bill or approves it with the said comments.

Between each such deliberation there shall be an interval of at least three days.

When a Bill has been approved by the Storting in two consecutive sittings, it is sent to the King with a request that it may receive the Royal Assent.


Article 78.
If the King assents to the Bill, he appends his signature, whereby it becomes law.

If he does not assent to it, he returns it to the Storting with a statement that he does not for the time being find it expedient to give his assent. In that case the Bill must not again be submitted to the King by the Storting then assembled.


Article 79.
If a Bill has been passed unaltered by two sessions of the Storting, constituted after two separate successive elections and separated from each other by at least two intervening sessions of the Storting, without a divergent Bill having been passed by any Storting in the period between the first and last adoption, and it is then submitted to the King with a petition that His Majesty shall not refuse his assent to a Bill which, after the most mature deliberation, the Storting considers to be beneficial, it shall become law even if the Royal Assent is not accorded before the Storting goes into recess.

Those responsible for the unwarranted arrest or illegal detention of a person shall be answerable to the person concerned.
